<div class="callout-warning"><strong>Security warning:</strong> Community themes are third-party code and are <strong>not vetted or audited</strong> by the Ava CMS project. A theme can include PHP (e.g. <code>theme.php</code>), templates, and assets that run with the same permissions as your site. Only install themes from authors you trust, review the source before deploying, and test in a staging environment.</div>
